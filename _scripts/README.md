### Universal Scripts
A bunch of scripts that are usable across multiple missions.

#### helo_random_cargo_delivery.sqf
*Full Script*<br />
Description: Spawns a Huron carrying a piece of cargo, dropping it at a nearby empty spot, and leaving again. Cargo is various logistical stuff. Returns an array containing the array of helicopters and the cargo.

#### sector_cap_ship_spawn.sqf
Spawns some ships on a point and moves them to a close-by coastal position.

#### sector_maker.sqf
*Semi-Finished Script*<br />
Script to work together with LARS Sector creation function. While working as intended, in hindsight could be done better and use some clean-up.
